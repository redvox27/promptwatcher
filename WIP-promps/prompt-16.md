## User Prompt
analyse the current docker-compose.yml file. OpenSearch is finally working. Now the app is struggling to connect with the open soarce server. find the bug and fix it

## Assistant Response
I've analyzed the docker-compose.yml file and found several issues preventing the API from connecting to OpenSearch:

1. **Service name mismatch**: The API is trying to connect to a service named `opensearch` but the OpenSearch service is actually named `opensearch-node1`. I fixed this by updating the `OPENSEARCH_HOST` environment variable in the API service.

2. **Network issues**: The services weren't explicitly in the same network, making hostname resolution unreliable. I added all services to a shared network called `opensearch-net`.

3. **Security issues**: The dashboards were trying to connect via HTTPS (`https://opensearch-node1:9200`) but security is disabled. I changed it to HTTP (`http://opensearch-node1:9200`).

4. **Missing health check**: The API was trying to start before OpenSearch was fully ready. I added a proper health check for the OpenSearch service.

5. **Simplified cluster configuration**: I simplified the OpenSearch cluster configuration by removing references to a non-existent second node.

6. **Added security plugin disabling**: Added `DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN=true` to ensure OpenSearch runs with security disabled.

These changes should fix the connection issues between the API and OpenSearch. The most important change was making sure the API uses the correct hostname (`opensearch-node1` instead of `opensearch`) to connect to the OpenSearch server.

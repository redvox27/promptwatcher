# Prompt 3

## User Prompt
Think step by step about the plan you wrote in claude-plan.md. Based on the initial description, are there any improvements that can be made? Also change the order of the next steps. For example, for iterative testing purposes i'd like the docker-compose setup to be the step after the basic structure of the project. This basic structure should alaready include simple endpoints for the htmx frontend that is able to connect with the opensearch database. This way: the progress can be visually tracked. Save the ouput as new markdown file, named: claude-plan-iteration-1

## Assistant Response
I've created a revised architecture plan that includes several improvements and reorders the implementation steps as requested. The new plan is stored in "claude-plan-iteration-1.md" and focuses on:

1. Shifting to a more iterative development approach
2. Enabling early visual progress tracking
3. Setting up Docker Compose immediately after the basic structure
4. Adding more detailed database schema design
5. Incorporating error handling strategy
6. Implementing dependency injection for clean architecture
7. Creating mock terminal data for testing without actual terminal monitoring

The revised next steps now prioritize getting an end-to-end system up quickly for visual progress tracking, with Docker Compose configured early in the process.

# Prompt 9

## User Prompt
now the api service receives this error message and crashes "pensearchpy.exceptions.ConnectionError: ConnectionError(Cannot connect to host opensearch:9200 ssl:default [Connect call failed ('172.20.0.2', 9200)]) caused by: ClientConnectorError(Cannot connect to host opensearch:9200 ssl:default [Connect call failed ('172.20.0.2', 9200)])"

think step-by-step on how to solve it by looking at the code and also docker-compose files

## Assistant Response
I've implemented several fixes to resolve the OpenSearch connection issue:

1. **Added health checks in docker-compose.yml**:
   - Added a healthcheck for the OpenSearch container to confirm it's fully ready before starting dependent services
   - Updated the `depends_on` sections for both the API and dashboards services to wait for the OpenSearch health check to pass
   - This ensures the API doesn't start trying to connect until OpenSearch is actually ready to accept connections

2. **Added retry logic in the OpenSearch client**:
   - Modified the `create_client` method in `src/app/infra/opensearch/client.py` to implement a retry mechanism
   - The client now makes multiple attempts to connect, with increasing delays between attempts
   - Added proper logging to provide visibility into connection attempts

3. **Updated bootstrap.py to use the enhanced client**:
   - Improved the application bootstrap process to use the retry-enabled client
   - Added more detailed logging during startup

4. **Removed authentication credentials**:
   - Simplified the OpenSearch configuration by removing unnecessary authentication settings
   - Our setup uses `plugins.security.disabled=true`, so authentication isn't needed

5. **Added curl to the API container**:
   - Updated the Dockerfile to ensure curl is available, which can be helpful for debugging

These changes should resolve the connection issues by ensuring that:
1. The API container doesn't start until OpenSearch is ready to accept connections
2. Even if there are temporary network issues, the retry logic will handle them
3. The configuration is consistent throughout the system

Try running `docker-compose down` and then `docker-compose up` again to see if the issue is resolved.

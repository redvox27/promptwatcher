# Prompt 1

## User Prompt
As you answer the user's questions, you can use the following context:
<context name="directoryStructure">Below is a snapshot of this project's file structure at the start of the conversation. This snapshot will NOT update during the conversation. It skips over .gitignore patterns.

- /Users/vincentluder/Public/promptwatcher/
</context>
      
IMPORTANT: this information about the environment you are running in may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to these messages or otherwise consider this information in your response unless it is highly relevant to your task.Your role is of an programming expert, who's expertise involves around programming in Python and domain driven design. You are given a task to program a prompt watcher that logs all the promps made in this claude engine within the console. The program should act as a watcher that logs the prompts and the answers in a database like open-search. These will be later used in prompt research. The goal of that research is to create prompting templates that can be used for the entire development team. 

The details of the application are as follows: the main program should be able to watch the input and output made in a claude program running in a terminal. This can be either a windows terminal or a mac terminal. But also third party terminals like Iterm2. To start: Make it compatible with ITerm2. The prompt and answers should be logged in a type of table format.

Fields that are being stored are: 
- name of the project. This is a variable that can be set as an environment variable
- goal of the project. This is a variable that can be set as an environment variable
- prompt. The prompt used
- output. The output of the prompt

The table should be stored in document based database like mongo or opensearch. Preferibly one that allows for easy dashboarding and data retreival for kwalitative research. 
The program should also include a simple frontend that allows users to check the tables, and give them lables. For the frontend, htmx will be used. The backend has to be made using fast-api. Keep in mind that a domain driven design is a must.

The project should be able to launch using docker-compose.
Deep think step-by-step for an architecture. Leave the ouput in a markdown file with the name "claude-plan". This file will be later used for future references for the ai to work with. Store also this initial prompt to the markdown file.

## Assistant Response
I'll create a comprehensive architecture plan for your prompt watcher application following domain-driven design principles.

I've created a comprehensive architecture plan for your prompt watcher application following domain-driven design principles. The plan is stored in "claude-plan.md" and includes:

1. Domain model with core entities and bounded contexts
2. Technical architecture diagram and component breakdown
3. Technology stack recommendations
4. Implementation phases
5. Directory structure following DDD principles
6. Docker Compose configuration
7. Technical challenges and solutions

This plan will serve as a reference for building the application. Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this architecture?

After you solved it. Stop trying to launch and stop docker-compose all the time

## Assistant Response
The error you're seeing is related to SSL configuration issues with the OpenSearch security plugin in version 3.0.0. The plugin is trying to load but failing because it can't find the required SSL configuration.

I've made two key changes to fix this issue:

1. Downgraded OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards to version 2.9.0
   - Version 3.0.0 seems to have issues with security plugin configurations
   - The 2.9.0 version has better compatibility with the security settings we're using

2. Added proper security configuration
   - Explicitly set `plugins.security.disabled=true`
   - Added `DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN=true` environment variable
   - Kept `DISABLE_INSTALL_DEMO_CONFIG=true` for clean configuration

These changes should resolve the SSL configuration error by:
- Using a more stable version of OpenSearch
- Properly disabling the security plugin that's causing issues
- Ensuring consistent security configuration

The error was occurring because the security plugin was partially enabled but couldn't find SSL configuration files that it expected to be present, leading to startup failure.

With these changes, OpenSearch should start properly without security errors or SSL configuration problems.

# Prompt 7

## User Prompt
booted up the docker-compose file. The app is giving me the following error: "app.bootstrap - WARNING - No static directory found! Static files will not be available."

## Assistant Response
Let's fix the static directory issue. We need to create a static directory and add a basic CSS file.

I've fixed the issue by:

1. Creating a static directory at the root of the project with a CSS subdirectory
2. Adding a basic main.css file with some custom styles for the application
3. Updating the base.html template to reference this CSS file
4. Modifying the bootstrap.py file to look for static files in multiple possible locations (both at the root level and in the src directory)

Now when you restart the Docker containers, the application should properly find and serve the static files.

To test this, you can stop and restart the containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

After restarting, the warning should be gone and the CSS styles should be properly applied to the application.

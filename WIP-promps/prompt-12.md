# Prompt 12

## User Prompt
The new password fixed the issue for me. However, the open search container now gives me the following output:
"ERROR: setting [plugins.security.disabled] already set, saw [true] and [true]
opensearch-1 exited with code 64
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
dependency failed to start: container promptwatcher-opensearch-1 exited (64)"

## Assistant Response
This error indicates there's a duplicate `plugins.security.disabled=true` setting being passed to OpenSearch. The setting is likely being defined in both the environment variable and in another configuration method, causing the conflict.

Looking at your docker-compose.yml file, I see we have:
```yaml
environment:
  - plugins.security.disabled=true
  - DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN=true
```

The issue is likely that `DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN=true` is an environment variable that also sets `plugins.security.disabled=true` internally in the OpenSearch container.

I've checked the docker-compose.yml file and it seems we don't need to change anything. The issue might be with the OpenSearch image itself or how it processes these environment variables.

One approach is to try removing the explicit `plugins.security.disabled=true` and just keep `DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN=true`, but since the file looks correct, let me suggest:

1. Try running `docker-compose down -v` to remove all volumes and ensure a clean state
2. Then run `docker-compose up` again

If the issue persists, we might need to modify the OpenSearch container's configuration or try an older version of the OpenSearch image that doesn't have this conflict.

# Prompt 2

## User Prompt
until the prompt watcher program is fully up and running, store all the prompts and answers that will be made from now on, including this one, in a new folder called WIP-promps. The filenames should be called "prompt-{number}" where number refers to the number of the prompt within the project structure. The numbers should be incremental. So the first prompt has number=1 and the second has number=2, etc.

## Assistant Response
I'll set up the WIP-prompts folder to store all prompts and answers, starting with this conversation.

I've created the WIP-promps directory and stored the first two prompts (including this one) as requested. Each prompt file includes both the user's input and my response, with sequential numbering.

# Prompt 11

## User Prompt
change the password to a complient password. This should be a password that consists of at least 8 characters of which one must be a special character and one a number.

## Assistant Response
I've updated the OpenSearch admin password in the docker-compose.yml file to a more secure, compliant password:

```
"OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=Secure123!"
```

This new password meets all the requirements:
- Contains at least 8 characters (10 characters total)
- Includes a special character (!)
- Includes numbers (123)
- Has both uppercase and lowercase letters

This password should satisfy OpenSearch's security requirements while still being easy to remember for development purposes. You'll need to restart the containers for this change to take effect:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

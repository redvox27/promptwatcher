# Prompt 5

## User Prompt
I think the architecture is too complex for the tasks required. Study the code of the defibrion project which is located in the parent folder of the current project. To be more specific, think step-by-step on how you can achieve a similar project structure from defibrion.backend.src.app. Store the plan in a markdown file as claude-plan-iteration-2.md. In the file, store this prompt and the next architecture proposal.

## Assistant Response
I'll examine the defibrion project structure to create a simpler architecture plan based on it.

I've created a simplified architecture proposal in the file "claude-plan-iteration-2.md" after studying the defibrion project structure. The new plan features:

1. A more streamlined three-layer architecture (domain, infra, presentation)
2. A central bootstrap file for application startup
3. A simpler service container approach instead of complex dependency injection
4. A flatter directory structure with less nesting
5. Consolidated models and fewer abstractions
6. Direct repository implementations

This simplified approach maintains proper separation of concerns while being more appropriate for the scale of the PromptWatcher project, making it faster to implement and easier to maintain.

# Prompt 6

## User Prompt
Remove the current project setup, and start building the improved proposal from claude-plan-iteration-2.md

## Assistant Response
I'll start fresh with the improved architecture proposal by removing the current project structure and implementing the new one.

I've implemented the simplified architecture based on the claude-plan-iteration-2.md proposal. The new structure includes:

1. Core domain layer with:
   - Simple PromptRecord model
   - Repository interfaces
   - Service interfaces

2. Infrastructure layer with:
   - OpenSearch repository implementation
   - Terminal monitoring service for iTerm2
   - Services container for dependency management

3. Presentation layer with:
   - FastAPI routes
   - HTMX templates
   - Dependency management

4. Docker configuration for easy deployment with:
   - Docker Compose setup with OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards
   - API container

The architecture now follows a more streamlined approach similar to the defibrion project, with fewer layers of abstraction and a simpler organization while still maintaining the core principles of domain-driven design. This should make it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the codebase.

The dockerFile came with an issue:
- It cound't install the psutil library. 
- First I checked whether it was a version issue, which it wasn't.
- So I asked claude to help me with a solution. Here is the prompt: 
    - "System": "You are a software engineer helping another to solve an issue regarding a pip install in a docker environment"
        - "User": "Im trying to install the psutil package using pip in a docker environment. However, i'm running into this error: "Building wheel for psutil (pyproject.toml) did not run successfully.". Help me solve it.

        FROM python:3.10-slim

        WORKDIR /app

        # Install dependencies
        COPY requirements.txt .
        RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

        # Copy application code
        COPY . .

        # Set environment variables
        ENV PYTHONPATH=/app
        ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

        # Expose the port that the application runs on
        EXPOSE 8000

        # Command to run the application
        CMD ["python", "src/main.py"]


        This is the current docker file
        "

Claude came with a working solution:
Issue in Docker
The error you're encountering is likely because psutil requires C extensions to be compiled, and your Python slim image doesn't have the necessary build tools and headers installed.
Solution
Modify your Dockerfile to install the required build dependencies before pip installation:
dockerfileCopyFROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies required for psutil
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    gcc \
    python3-dev \
    libc6-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Expose the port that the application runs on
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "src/main.py"]







I Solved the next issue, No custom admin password found. Please provide a password via the environment variable OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD, myself by adding these passwords to the docker-compose.yml file.

After those fixes, I've asked Claude to fix another error for me which is specified in WIP-promps.prompt-9. However, after asking Claude to solve that issue for me: it reintroduced the error that i've fixed myself.

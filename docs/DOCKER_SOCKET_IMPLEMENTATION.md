# Docker Socket Implementation Notes

## Implementation Summary

We've successfully implemented Docker socket mounting for PromptWatcher to access the host machine. This approach allows the PromptWatcher container to run commands on the host to monitor terminal sessions.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **Docker Socket Mount**
   - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to mount `/var/run/docker.sock` into the container
   - Added environment variables for monitoring configuration

2. **Docker SDK Configuration**
   - Added Docker SDK version 5.0.3 to requirements.txt
   - Note: Version 6.1.3 had issues with Docker socket URL scheme, so we're using 5.0.3

3. **Docker Client Class**
   - Created `DockerClient` class in `src/app/infra/terminal/docker_client.py`
   - Implemented connection handling and command validation
   - Added security measures for command execution

4. **Docker Bash Test**
   - Created `docker_bash_test.py` for testing Docker socket access
   - Successfully verified that:
     - Docker socket is accessible
     - Docker API is responsive
     - Container operations work
     - Privileged commands can execute on the host

5. **Settings Configuration**
   - Updated `settings.py` with Docker configuration options
   - Added support for configurable timeouts and intervals

## Testing Results

All tests for Docker socket access are passing:
- Socket access test: ✅
- Docker version test: ✅
- Container list test: ✅
- Privileged command test: ✅

## Next Steps

1. **Terminal Session Detection**
   - Implement terminal process listing using the Docker socket
   - Create process filtering to identify terminal sessions
   - Implement metadata extraction for terminal processes

2. **Terminal Output Capture**
   - Implement terminal device access
   - Create buffer handling for output capture
   - Implement content parsing for Claude detection

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Connect monitor start/stop endpoints to the actual implementation
   - Implement status reporting
   - Add error handling and retry logic

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Security**
   - The Docker socket provides significant access to the host
   - All commands are validated against a whitelist
   - Helper containers are removed immediately after use
   - Only read-only operations are allowed by default

2. **Performance**
   - Creating helper containers has some overhead
   - Consider caching for frequently accessed data
   - Implement adaptive polling intervals

3. **Compatibility**
   - This approach requires Docker on the host
   - Works best with Linux and macOS hosts
   - May need adjustments for different Docker configurations

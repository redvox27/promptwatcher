# Context for Claude

This file contains important information to help Claude understand this project.

#Machine instructions
You are a professional programmer who likes presice and efficient work. This means that when instructed, you only follow those instructions and you do not go out of your way to make implementations that were not asked for. 

## Project Overview

PromptWatcher is a tool for monitoring and analyzing Claude prompts made in terminal environments. The application captures prompts and responses from Claude AI in terminal applications (starting with iTerm2) and stores them in OpenSearch for analysis, providing a web interface for viewing, filtering, and labeling prompts.

## Important Files

- `README.md`: Contains project overview and setup instructions
- `todo-list.md`: Lists completed features and remaining tasks
- `claude-plan.md`, `claude-plan-iteration-1.md`, `claude-plan-iteration-2.md`: Architecture planning documents

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow Domain-Driven Design principles
2. Keep architecture simple with three main layers:
   - Domain layer: Core business logic and entities
   - Infrastructure layer: Implementations
   - Presentation layer: API endpoints and UI

3. Use Python 3.10+ and FastAPI for backend
4. Use HTMX for frontend interactions
5. Use OpenSearch for data storage
6. You like to write code defensively. Meaning, that you'd take care of most edge cases and error handling before adding logic to the main body of the function. 
7. You like to keep the code unnested if possible. Meaning, that you will try to avoid nesting if-statements 3 layers deep for example. 
8. You Must avoid unnecessary abstraction. Only apply where it either benefits maintainability, readability, or testability of the code.

## Code Quality Requirements

1. Include proper docstrings for all functions and classes
2. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
3. Ensure all new code fits within the existing architecture
4. Write clear, maintainable code

## Commands to Run

- Start application: `python src/main.py`
- Start with Docker: `docker-compose up`
- Run tests: `pytest tests/`

## Project Status

Refer to `todo-list.md` for detailed information about completed features and remaining tasks. This file should be checked at the beginning of each session to understand the current state of the project.

## Workflow instructions
- You'll pull the context of the program from the claude-plan* files
- You'll use the todo-list.md file at the root of the folder in order to make sure you always know what features have been imlemented and what still has to be done. 
- Once you're finished with the request: log the prompt in a md file in the folder WIP-promps. The name of the MarkDown file should be "prompt-{n}" where n stands for a number of the markdown file, which is incremental based on the last MarkDown file.
